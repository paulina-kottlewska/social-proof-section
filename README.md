## My process

### Design

I was provided with a design for this project from Frontend Mentor. The design was clear and user-friendly. I had to recreate this design and bring it to life using HTML and CSS.

### Development

I started by structuring the HTML using semantic elements, and then styled the webpage with CSS, making use of variables for consistent colors. I made the website responsive by utilizing media queries and a mobile-first design approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of CSS Grid, media queries, and responsive design. I also gained practical experience in converting design files into functional webpages.
